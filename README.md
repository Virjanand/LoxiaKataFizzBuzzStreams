# FizzBuzz
In this project FizzBuzz is solved using streams.

The goal is to have a class that returns a string for a number:  
1 -> "1"  
2 -> "2"  
3 -> "Fizz"  
4 -> "4"  
5 -> "Buzz"  
6 -> "Fizz"  
7 -> "7"  
8 -> "8"  
9 -> "Fizz"  
10 -> "Buzz"  
...  
15 -> "FizzBuzz"  
etc.  

This will be done by using strict TDD and take as small steps as possible.
